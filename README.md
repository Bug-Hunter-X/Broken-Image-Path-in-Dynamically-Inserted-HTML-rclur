# Broken Image Path Bug in HTML
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to dynamically inserting an image into an HTML page using JavaScript. The bug stems from an incorrect image source path, which results in a broken image being displayed.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when a script attempts to dynamically add an image element to an HTML document.  If the provided source path for the image is incorrect (e.g., points to a non-existent file, uses a wrong relative path, or refers to an image not accessible on the server), the image won't render, and you'll encounter a broken image icon in its place.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the broken image where the image should be.

## Solution
The solution involves correcting the image source path to point to a valid image file that is accessible. This usually means reviewing the file path and making sure the image is in the correct location.
